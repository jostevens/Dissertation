Dissertation Documentation
========================================================

My Dissertation is going to test some of the assupmtions and hypotheses of world/global cities theory.
The assupmtion that I want to test deals with the unit of analysis. Most of the work done in this field deals with cities, but the deffinintion of cities is not well defined. There have been multiple units of analysis used including, municiple boundaries, metro areas, aggregated countys, etc.
The issue of scale can be quite problematic. As geographers found out long ago, changing the spatial unit often dramatically changes the result. This problem is so pronounced that it has its own name, the modifiable areal unit problem or MAUP. According to some theorists there is no good solution to this problem. The first thing that I need to do is to figure out the appropriate unit of analysis.

After the MAUP problem is dealt with the next order of business is to analyze the amount of spatial segregation that exists in the areas and determine how much of it can be explained by connections to the global or national urban hierarchies.

For the U.S. Airline data there is a freely available 10% origin and destination sample of all flights with an Origin or Destination in the U.S.. It can be accessed [here](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=289&DB_Short_Name=Origin%20and%20Destination%20Survey), and Neal (citation) has created a nice writeup of the data and created a stata program to use this data to create a network object. The problem is that the BTS interface only allows for downloading one quarter of data at a time (ie 2013 Q1). Since I need a bit more data than that I found that the following command will download a years worth of data if run through the java script console in the chrome or firefox browser:

```
document.form1.sqlstr.value = 
" SELECT ITIN_ID, MKT_ID, SEQ_NUM, ORIGIN, DEST, YEAR, QUARTER FROM T_DB1B_COUPON WHERE YEAR=2008"

document.form1.submit()
```

This code runs the javascript function which passes an SQL string to the government's database.
I did try and get all of the data from 2000 - 2010, but the resulting file was too large. Instead, to avoid over-burdening the server, I iterated years by hand.

The above code will get one of two files that are needed to create the network object, the other requires different fields and a different database name:

```
document.form1.sqlstr.value = " SELECT ITIN_ID, PASSENGER, ITIN_FARE, ROUNDTRIP, YEAR, QUARTER FROM T_DB1B_TICKET WHERE YEAR=2008"

document.form1.submit()
```

The files will be downloaded as zipped csvs. The uncompressed file sizes range from 15Mb to 1.7Gb. I manually renamed the files with the year and the type of file; 'c' for the coupon data and 't' for the ticket data, followed by the year - 'c2001'.

Once the files were renamed I used the following code to import them into a Postgres database which I had previously set up to hold my geographic data. The code reads in the list of csv files, and loops through the list createing a new table and schema, then copying the data from the csv files into the database. Then there are a couple of lines disconnect the r session from the database and close the drivers. The next section uses dplyr to churn through all of that data and give a compressed file with the origin and destination airport as well as the total number of trips and passengers.
