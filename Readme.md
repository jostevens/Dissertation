Dissertation
------------

My dissertation deals with testing some of the assumptions of world cities theory. The first assumption to test is the appropriate geographic unit of analysis. Next I'll look at the pattern of network connections at the global and regional level to see if they are similar. Finally I want to look at how living in world cities (or not) effects inequality.
